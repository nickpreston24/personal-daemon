<strong>S</strong>alvation begins and ends with the Lord Jesus Christ, God Almighty and Creator of all that exists:

“Looking to Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith, Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right of the throne of God” (Hebrews 12:2 MKJV).

Jesus said: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16 MKJV).

Reader, put aside all your religious background, experience, and doctrine. Simply put it all away. Your relationship with God has nothing to do with those things. <strong>What you need is Jesus Christ's blood.</strong> Without His blood, you are dead, no matter what or how much you know or do. <strong>Without His blood IN you, there is no difference.</strong>

When once His blood is coursing through your veins, you have life, new life, lasting, indestructible life indeed. <strong>His blood IN you makes all the difference.</strong> It is His life in you (the life is in the blood). Then you know you are right with Him. Then will you have His assurance and peace.

Jesus said: “Those who eat My flesh and drink My blood live in Me, and I live in them. The Father Who has life sent Me, and I live because of the Father. So those who feed on Me will live because of Me” (John 6:56-57 GW).

He also said: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one comes to the Father but by Me” (John 14:6 MKJV).

By the Spirit of God, John the apostle wrote: “And this is the record, that God has given to us everlasting life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life” (1 John 5:11-12 MKJV).

You are either saved, or you are not saved. You either have the Son, or you do not have the Son.

The apostle Peter said: “And there is salvation in no other One; for there is no other Name under Heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12 MKJV).

He was speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ, also known in Hebrew as Yehoshua HaMashiach, which means “YHVH – God - is salvation” or “He Who is (or will be) saves,” the Anointed.

One cannot make up his mind to be saved or choose the time or way. It is entirely God's work:

“For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them” (Ephesians 2:8-10 MKJV).

<strong>I</strong>f you find yourself abhorring yourself and your sin, finding this world losing its attraction and meaningfulness, and desperately desiring to know God and do His will, it is only because He has given this to you. These are all very promising indicators, for which you will one day be thankful if you follow through to the end. All these things are in the Lord's hand; He makes the way and chooses the time and instrumentalities, the people, words, and circumstances, to bring one to salvation. Of Him it is said:

“No one can come to Me unless the Father Who has sent Me draw him, and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught of God.' Therefore everyone who hears and learns from the Father comes to Me” (John 6:44-45 MKJV).

Religion will not save you. Church membership and attendance will not save you. Good deeds will not save you, no matter how great they may be. “Being good and not hurting anybody” will not save you. Doctrine, even if true, will not save you. Much study and knowledge will not save you. Knowing truths will not save you. Understanding and wisdom of the world will not save you. Your pastor or priest or elder or parent or any kind of spiritual mentor or guide will not save you.

One is not physically born with, or into, salvation, no matter your family religious affiliations, and no matter if your parents are saved. Only Jesus Christ revealing Himself to, and apprehending you, will save you. There is nothing you can do to save yourself except what God gives you to do. If you are given to do what we now present, it is your time for salvation.

The Scriptures, as written by Paul the apostle, declare:

Romans 10:6-13 MKJV
(6) But the righteousness of faith says this: “Do not say in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down;
(7) or “Who shall descend into the deep?”; that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.
(8) But what does it say? “The Word is near you, even in your mouth and in your heart”; that is, the Word of Faith which we proclaim;
(9) <strong>Because if you confess the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</strong>
(10) <strong>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses unto salvation.</strong>
(11) For the Scripture says, “Everyone believing on Him shall not be put to shame.”
(12) For there is no difference both of Jew and of Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call on Him.
(13) For everyone, “<strong>whoever shall call on the Name of the Lord will be saved.</strong>”

Know and understand that all of mankind are sinners, that we cannot save ourselves; only God can do so, and will, when He chooses. If you find yourself crying out to Him, as I did, your day of salvation approaches. Put away pride and stubbornness; be prepared to put away your comfortable doctrines and receive the Truth; be prepared to believe not what you want to believe or have been taught to believe, but what you must believe to be saved. If you are not saved and are not at peace, consider that what you have believed has not been effective for your salvation. Still, He will do all that for you:

“Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, cultivate your own salvation with fear and trembling. <strong>For it is God Who works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure</strong>” (Philippians 2:12-13 MKJV).

Jesus said: “And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free” (John 8:32 EMTV).

And: “Therefore if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free” (John 8:36 EMTV).

Know that there is a false and deceptive gospel and way to salvation being commonly preached by millions of very nice and sincere people claiming to be saved, which gospel has deceived many. In a nutshell, they may instruct you like this: “Say, ‘Jesus, I confess I am a sinner (because all men are sinners). I know that You died on the cross for me and everyone else to pay for all sins. I accept You as My Savior and ask You to come into my heart.”

<strong>J</strong>esus is the One Who will do the accepting here with you and with all. He is Lord; He rules the universe He created. He is not here begging or wishing you would let Him do something for you or that you would do something for Him, as though He needs you. Believe me, He doesn't. Hear what John the Baptist had to say to the presumptuous, who thought they were doing God a favor by coming out to see John and be baptized:

“Then he said to the crowds which came out to be baptized by him, ‘Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones. And even now the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and is thrown into the fire'” (Luke 3:7-9 EMTV).

He is Lord, don't you forget it; and the only way He will ever be your Savior is by being your Lord, your Master, your Possessor, all of which He is, regardless of where you stand or what you think. He reigns supreme over all, always has and always will.

I will not put words in your mouth or assume that you can do things rightly, but I advise you that if God is drawing you, then talk to Him, not religiously or formally - nothing fancy - but with respect, in reverence. You cannot fool or surprise Him. <strong>Trust Him.</strong> He knows you completely and is in full control. The Bible says:

“But without faith it is impossible to please God, for it is necessary for the one approaching God to believe that He is, and that He becomes a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him” (Hebrews 11:6 EMTV).

<strong>A</strong>sk Him to give you faith, which is a gift and nothing you can muster up. Seek after Him and do not ever quit, no matter how discouraged you may feel at any point. Here is a Scriptural promise by the Spirit of God through Jeremiah the prophet:

“And you will go on crying to Me and making prayer to Me, and I will give ear to you. And you will be searching for Me and I will be there, when you have gone after Me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:12-13 BBE).

Ask the Lord of lords to take over your life and make it new. Ask Him to take away your sins and grant you <a href="https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/repentance.htm">repentance</a> and a new nature so that you will not sin any more. Sin is breaking God's Law as recorded in the Scriptures and condensed in the Ten Commandments.

While you must try and will know you need to keep the Law of God, you will fail and come to find that keeping It will not save you; It is impossible to keep. That is why you need salvation. Salvation is God's enabling you to keep the Law by a new nature. That is what grace is – His enabling you to be in harmony with His will.

The Law is there to lead you into the grace of God in Christ:

“Therefore the Law has become our custodian, leading us to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith” (Galatians 3:24 EMTV).

If you start on the Way, do not rebel and seek another way, but continue on faithfully, and He will give you grace. Remember, “...a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity” (Proverbs 24:16 HNV).

How are the fallen righteous (those who seek to do right) raised up?

“But I call on God, and the LORD saves me” (Psalms 55:16 GW).

For God says: “Call on Me in the day of trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor Me” (Psalms 50:15 HNV).

Know that God would have you to prosper in doing what is right, and to have life. That is giving Him honor.

How can you know that when you need help doing right, He answers? Here is a promise through John the apostle, who spoke these words by Jesus Christ:

“And this is the confidence that we have toward Him, that if we should ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we <strong>have</strong> the requests that we have requested from Him” (1 John 5:14-15 EMTV).

How do we know we ask according to His will if we ask Him to save us? Here it is:

“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, <strong>not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance</strong>” (2 Peter 3:9 KJV).

<strong>T</strong>here is much testimony in Scripture that declares God wills that all come to salvation in their due time. Always remember and be fully persuaded of these words He spoke for those who seek Him:

“So I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; Seek, and you shall find; Knock, and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. And which father among you, if his son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion? <strong>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!</strong>” (Luke 11:9-13 EMTV)

He knows you. He knew you ages ago. He knows all about you. Don't play games with Him or with His servants. What He wants is that you be honest with Him, as bad as you are, as bad as you think, as ashamed as you are. He does not accept you the way you are, as many teach. On the other hand, you cannot make yourself presentable or acceptable to Him. He will receive you as you cry out to Him, and He will then begin to change you to be what He originally intended you to be.

<strong>T</strong>he moment you are saved, life will only begin for you. You will realize you were dead. You will begin the journey of being able to be your real self, the person He intended you to be, which has been impossible for you until salvation, as impossible as it is for the miserable remains of an old car, torn apart and rusting in a junkyard or bush, to run. As that wreck experienced nothing but death and defeat and could do nothing useful, so you will discover the same for yourself. But as that car can be restored to a new, shiny specimen to be admired by many, so you will be restored to newness of life and to true usefulness.

Just don't be expected to be admired by the world, however. The Lord has promised and warned that just as they hated Him, so they will hate you if you identify with Him. It is the price you must pay, so count the cost before you start:

“And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. And the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death. And you will be hated of all men for My name's sake, but the one who endures to the end shall be kept safe. But when they persecute you in this city, flee into another; for truly I say to you, In no way shall you have finished the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes. A disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he is like his master, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?” (Matthew 10:21-25 MKJV)

Having said that, the Lord did promise great things for the faithful:

“And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel's sake, but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternal life” (Mark 10:29-30 MKJV).

“And if we are children, then we are heirs; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; so that if we suffer with Him, we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creation was not willingly subjected to vanity, but because of Him Who subjected it on hope that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God” (Romans 8:17-21 MKJV).

We are here to aid all those the Lord calls and chooses at this time and in the future to be His. Read <a href="https://www.thepathoftruth.com/teachings/holy-waters.htm">Holy Waters</a>, and ask us for direction, no matter who you are or what kind of sins you may have committed, or even how good you think you should appear to be – put away your pride – it is a great barrier to God. The Bible says God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.

<strong>A</strong>s God is no respecter of persons, so we, by God's grace, are no respecters of persons. We care not if you are black, white, rich, poor, young, old, married, single, a murderer, thief, blasphemer, Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, homosexual, drug dealer, prostitute, theologian, Bible teacher, elder, deacon, pastor, evangelist (famous or otherwise), priest, bishop, nun, cardinal, or even the pope. Believe us – they all need saving, and the staunchly religious have the hardest time of it above drunkards, addicts, and prostitutes, because they think they have it together but do not. Jesus even said so:

“But what do you think? A man had two children. And having come to the first, he said, ‘Child, go, work today in my vineyard.' But he answered and said, ‘I will not,' but later he regretted it and went. And having come to the other, he said likewise. And he answered and said, ‘I am going, sir,' but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father? They said to Him, The first. Jesus said to them, Assuredly I say to you, that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; but you, having seen, did not repent afterwards, that you might believe him” (Matthew 21:28-32 EMTV).

<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not go to those who charge in any way for their counsel, or even sell you anything. Do not go to those who put their names in lights or name some religious organization after themselves. They cannot help you because if they could, they would not charge or promote themselves in any way. These preach another gospel, I assure you:

“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works” (2 Corinthians 11:13-15 EMTV).

<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not ever believe He cannot save you:

“Therefore He was obligated to become like His brothers in all respects, in order that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, in order that He might make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that which He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted” (Hebrews 2:17-18 EMTV).

Again, Jesus said that with God, all things are possible.

<strong>Warning:</strong> Do not believe the devil is too powerful or that temptations are too great for you to overcome. These are only unjustified fears or lies or excuses to hang on to your gods and thwart you from the great blessing of life:

“No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, Who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation, He will also make the way out, so as for you to be able to bear it. Wherefore, my beloved, <strong>flee from idolatry</strong>” (1 Corinthians 10:13-14 EMTV).

God bless the earnest seeker for Him (He <strong>always</strong> does). Know that He is altogether able and faithful:

“And looking on them, Jesus said to them, ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible'” (Matthew 19:26 EMTV).

Of Jesus, the Hebrews writer says: “But He, because He remains forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those coming to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them” (Hebrews 7:24-25 EMTV).

<strong>Warning:</strong> If you are hearing this Word of God that He has sent us to preach, do not forsake the fellowship of His Body. Come and submit yourself to the Head through those whom He has appointed as ministers of the gospel and shepherds for your souls. There are no lone rangers in the fellowship of believers, but all are brought together for the same Goal:

“Remember those leading you, who have spoken to you the Word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conduct: Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever” (Hebrews 13:7-8 MKJV).

“Now to Him Who is able to do exceedingly more than all the things which we ask or think, according to the power which is working in us, to Him be glory in the church in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen” (Ephesians 3:20-21 EMTV).

<strong>W</strong>hen you are saved, you will not necessarily <strong>feel</strong> saved, but you will <strong>know</strong> you are saved. The witness of God's Spirit to your spirit will confirm you are saved:

“The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God” (Romans 8:16 MKJV).

Remember that your life will be transformed:

“So that if any one is in Christ, that one is a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Corinthians 5:17 MKJV).

Know also that there are three steps of the salvation process, as God illustrated by the three basic solemn feasts - Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles.
